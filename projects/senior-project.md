### The Setup
- The hypothetical client was expanding their manufacturing facility with a new industrial warehouse
- Our project involved 3 teams: materials handling, mechanical, and structural

### My Contribution
- I was responsible for the structural design of the crane system, including load calculations and material selection.
- Designed the layout and support structure for the crane in accordance with structural standards (e.g. AISC Steel Manual, Steel Specification, ASCE/SEI Codes).
- Also was responsible for researching and selecting paint booths for a hypothetical production line.
- Collaborated with other teams to ensure building structure could support design loads and that paint booths were compatible with material flow.

### Overview And Technical Constraints
This project was an academic simulation of a real-world engineering firm-style project. My role was split into two main parts, crane structure design and paint booth selection. Given the short timespan of the project, I spend the most time on the crane structure design, and less time on the paint booth setup (although I ensured that the paint booths met all relevant standards / constraints). Some of the main constraints for the crane design included:

- **Load Capacity and Rating:** The crane was required to lift a certain load (10 tons), with a particular frequency of movement.
- **Structural Standards:** There are many structural standards for the crane support structure, governing aspects such as deflection limits, safety factors, and load combinations.
- **Economics:** Support structure was to exceed the required load and deflection limits while still minimizing material usage and cost.

Designing a proper crane support structure involved analysis of worst-case loading scenarios

### Features
- **Seamless Integration with Current Workflow:** The crane system was designed to tie directly into the building’s layout and material handling line, ensuring uninterrupted flow between fabrication and finishing processes.  
- **Validated Structural Safety:** Runway beams, columns, and bracing were sized to exceed load and deflection requirements while maintaining safety factors specified in AISC and ASCE/SEI standards.  
- **Economical, Practical Design:** Built-up members, fillet welds, and standardized steel grades were chosen to balance safety, reliability, and cost. Wherever possible, details were simplified for fabrication efficiency.  
- **Flexible Paint Booth Setup:** Booths were specified with cross-draft airflow, OSHA-compliant ventilation, and monorail access slots so that different payload types could be accommodated without redesign.  

### Technical Challenges
- - **Proper Data Combination:** One of the most difficult aspects was reconciling manufacturer data with governing codes (CMAA, AISC, ASCE/SEI, IBC). In many cases, manufacturer loads were optimistic, so I recalculated forces (wheel loads, lateral/longitudinal loads, bumper impact) and used the more conservative values in design.  
- **Worst-Case Loading:** Support members had to be checked for simultaneous crane usage, dynamic impact, and bracing under bumper loads. For example, end-stop impacts were modeled using work-energy methods and conservative assumptions about bumper deformation.  
- **Fatigue and Serviceability:** Crane runway connections are subject to repetitive stress; detailing had to allow end rotation and minimize fatigue. Tolerances were also tight — deflection limits were L/600 vertically and L/400 laterally.  
- **Cross-Team Coordination:** The crane support had to integrate with HVAC clearances, floor plans, and structural foundations. Similarly, the paint booths had to be placed for efficient material movement while respecting airflow, drainage, and structural loading.

The project required detailed drawings to specify how the support structure would be assembled, including the connection details.
