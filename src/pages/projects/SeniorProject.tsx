            <p className="text-md text-gray-700 mb-4">This project was an academic simulation of a real-world engineering firm-style project. My role was split into two main parts, crane structure design and paint booth selection. Some of the main constraints for the crane design included:</p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc ml-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1 mb-2">
              <li><strong>Client Requirements:</strong>  Meetings with the client were required to establish design constraints for the crane system (e.g. maximum capacity, speed, service class) and paint booths (e.g. size, airflow, etc.).</li>
              <li><strong>Team Member Input:</strong>  Collaboration and communication with team members was necessary to ensure building structure could support the crane system and that adequate clearances / safety standards were maintained.</li>
              <li><strong>Structural / Safety Compliance:</strong>  The support structure design and safety standards were governed by various codes and standards (e.g. AISC, ASCE/SEI, CMAA, IBC, OSHA).</li>
              <li><strong>Economics:</strong>  Support structure was to meet all safety and serviceability requirements while minimizing material and assembly costs.</li>

            <ul className="list-inside list-disc ml-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1 mb-2">
              <li><strong>Load Combinations and Analysis:</strong>  The crane system was designed to accommodate various load combinations, including static, dynamic, and impact loads. Detailed analysis was performed to ensure all potential loading scenarios were considered.</li>
              <li><strong>Structural Component Selection:</strong>  Runway beams, columns, and bracing were sized to exceed load and deflection requirements while maintaining safety factors specified in AISC and ASCE/SEI standards. Built-up members were selected to optimize material usage while ensuring structural integrity.</li>
              <li><strong>Connection Detailing:</strong>  Welds, bolts, and other connections were designed to ensure proper load transfer and structural integrity. Detailing was performed to account for fabrication and assembly processes.</li>
              <li><strong>Flexible Paint Booth Setup:</strong>  Booths were specified with cross-draft airflow, OSHA-compliant ventilation, and monorail access slots so that different payload types could be accommodated without redesign.</li>
              <li><strong>Thorough Research and Compliance:</strong>  This project was entirely self-driven, requiring extensive research into relevant codes, standards, and best practices and collaboration with other engineers to ensure all aspects of the design met or exceeded industry requirements.</li>

                  <li><strong>Analysis of built-up members:</strong>  Calculating section properties of built-up members took extensive analysis, as well as stress and deflection analysis under combined loads such as shear, torsion, and biaxial bending.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Worst-Case Loading:</strong>  Support members had to be checked for simultaneous crane usage, dynamic impact, and bracing under bumper loads. For example, end-stop impacts were modeled using work-energy methods and conservative assumptions about bumper deformation.</li>
              <li><strong>Fatigue and Serviceability:</strong>  Crane runway connections are subject to repetitive stress; detailing had to allow end rotation and minimize fatigue. Tolerances were also tight â€” deflection limits were L/600 vertically and L/400 laterally.</li>
              <li><strong>Cross-Team Coordination:</strong>  The crane support had to integrate with HVAC clearances, floor plans, and structural foundations. Similarly, the paint booths had to be placed for efficient material movement while respecting airflow, drainage, and structural loading.</li>
